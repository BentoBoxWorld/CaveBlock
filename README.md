CaveBlock is an addon for BentoBox, so to run CaveBlock, you must have BentoBox installed. It is not a Bukkit plugin and trying to use it as one will not work.

## Translation

Like most BentoBox projects, the CaveBlock Addon is translatable into any language. Everyone can contribute, and translate some parts of the addon into their language via [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/2968).
If your language is not in the list, please contact the developers via Discord, and it will be added.

## Installation

0. Install BentoBox and run it on the server at least once to create its data folders.
1. Place this jar in the addons folder of the BentoBox plugin.
2. Restart the server.
3. The addon will create worlds and a data folder and inside the folder will be a config.yml.
4. Stop the server.
5. Edit the config.yml how you want.
6. Delete any worlds that were created by default if you made changes that would affect them.
7. Restart the server.

## Config.yml

The config.yml is similar to BSkyblock and AcidIsalnd but *not the same*. It has some additional or changed parameters, like,
instead of world-height it has world-depth.

### Other Add-ons

CaveBlock is an add-on that uses the BentoBox API. Here are some other ones that you may be interested in:

* Level - provides island level calculation and a top ten - may need some adjusments, as main block will be over all island.
* Welcome Warps - provides the warp sign feature
* Challenges - challenges
* Biomes - allows to change biomes per island
* Greenhouses - allows to create green houses that provides some biome specific materials / mobs.
* invSwitcher - allows to switch inventories between gamemode worlds

You can find the projects on GitHub.
